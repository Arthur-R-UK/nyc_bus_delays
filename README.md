This dataset is from the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority (NYC MTA) buses data stream service. In roughly 10 minute increments the bus location, route, next stop and more is recorded. Using this data, I aim to identify where buses tend to pick up delays, in order to propose where additional journey time should be built into the timetable to increase punctuality performance.

Here I have used the 1706 dataset, but the code should work equally well for any of the other datasets from the group, or (with enough running time) for the compiled datasets.

Includes:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Understanding, manipulation and visualisation of geographical data
* Handling very large datasets
